# Life expectancy analysis

In this project aims at answering the question: How can a state improve the citizens life expectancy?  

To answer this, we used a dataset that put together 17 variables for 119 states and after conferming the normality of the data we applied many statistical approaches (all detailes are found in the presentation) and managed to find a linear model to analyze the correlation and causality of the variables with life expectancy.  

The answer to our question can be summarized as follows:  
There is significant correlation of life expectancy with schooling, access to drinkable water and helthcare expenses. So a good direction for a state would be to invest in this areas.
